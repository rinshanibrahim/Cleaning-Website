        <h1>Our Team</h1><br>
        <p>jIn any industry where the people behind a company are as important as the company itself,
           you’re likely to find a kind of expanded “about” page that includes information on individual
           employees. “Meet the Team” pages are popular among web design and other creative firms, but 
           are also found on sites within various other industries. These pages are a valuable addition 
           to any site where human contact is an important part of the industry.It adds a personal touch
            to the company and can lend trust to visitors.
